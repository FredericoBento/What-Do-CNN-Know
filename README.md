# What Do CNN Know?

The primary goal of this final Bachelorâ€™s degree project was to explore and analyze the effectiveness and precision of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in identifying and responding to specific features in images. This study aimed to deepen the understanding of CNN behavior concerning feature variability, with a particular focus on their robustness and limitations in feature detection. As part of this work, a comprehensive final report was written, detailing the methods, findings, and conclusions of the study. The report is available in this repository.
